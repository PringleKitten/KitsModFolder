HEY YOU.
If you wanna use the 480 720 and 1080p videos, you have to download them separately in "The Power of Terry/Videos"
IDK why it does that, but yeah, if you download just the Green Code Button you will only have access to the 360p video.
The video names are in order of size. so yeah. A,B,C,D: 360,480,720,1080
